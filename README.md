# spam_classification_shiny_app

For our final project of DS 400: Bayesian Statistics, we were assigned with a project inspired by https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection, were we downloaded our raw data from. 

From there, we cleaned the data and created data visulizations to understand the components of our data and identify key variables to implement into a Bayesian model.
